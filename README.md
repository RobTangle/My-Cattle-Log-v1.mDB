## How to run the front-end:

From the main directory, follow this commands:

After having the Database prepared to be synced, in the directory /api run the following commands:

\*If you haven't installed the packages yet, run:

npm install

npm run dev

\*If you already installed the packages with the command "npm install", now type the following command to run de back-end:
